So it’s been a bit of a whirlwind. My first official week of PA school is over. It was pretty chaotic, filled with classes, lots information, new people, and a little stress. I think I’m getting the hang of it, but then again, it’s supposed to get even busier… <!--end-->

Most of my time last week was consumed with anatomy. We are responsible for 4 classes this summer, but the bulk of our time will be devoted to anatomy, both the cadaver dissection and the lecture. And for good reason; there’s just so much information to know. But I already see a difference this time around compared to last time. I feel like I’m understanding relationships between structures better, and integrating the material faster. Apparently there is still a foundation there, despite the fact that I was sure I had dumped all anatomy knowledge from my brain.

Let me just say, if you can get into a PA program that allows you to do cadaver dissection in anatomy, definitely go there. It is so much more of a learning experience than I ever imagined. I took a pretty rigorous anatomy course during my prerequisite post-bacc, and we had cadaver lab, but we didn’t do any dissection. I guess I didn’t understand how much learning occurs during the actual dissection. I think once you spend hours looking for a structure, it sort of becomes ingrained in your head. It’s been a very difficult, but rewarding, part of my experience so far. 

I did some studying early this morning, (anatomy), took a quiz, (anatomy), and then took a well-needed break with some friends. But the To Do List is long. I have a lot of work to do tomorrow. I feel like that may just be the name of the game from here on out. I guess I should get used to it?
