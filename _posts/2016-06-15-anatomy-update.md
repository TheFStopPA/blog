Wow. I don’t even know where to begin. So anatomy has been really fun actually. And I should preface this first with a disclaimer: I didn’t like anatomy the first time around. I mean, I *liked* it enough, as in, I’m a science nerd and it was interesting and fascinating to see a cadaver and learn the structures.<!--end--> But I hated the rote memorization, the endless material, and the lack of context. It didn’t help that I was taking Organic Chemistry and Cell Biology at the same time, (I would not recommend that, by the way), so I never really got a chance to dive into the material.

But this time it’s different. Don’t get me wrong, the volume is much larger, the time frame is much faster, and the material is more in depth that my undergraduate class. The difference however, is that I finally feel like I have the time to truly devote to the material. And as a result, it’s making anatomy so much more meaningful to me. Weird how that works, right? Invest the time, reap the rewards. 

This time around however, is much more self-directed. I’ve heard this is true of many programs. Our professor will lecture according to the syllabus, and there will be scheduled lab time, but ultimately, it’s up to me to get the required material covered in time for the exam. It’s up to my dissection group to go in on our own time to catch up on our dissection lab. Basically, the resources I use are up to me, the pace I study is up to me, and the way I study is up to me. There are no required readings, not even optional readings. It’s really just up to me to ask for help and guidance, and to effectively structure my time.

So, **how do you do it?** Well, to be fair, it’s barely been two weeks, so easy to say that I’m still learning and adjusting. But here are some of my tips thus far.

* Study in chunks, and study often and early.
* Come back to material that you think you’ve mastered.
* **_DO NOT_** make physical flashcards. If you must make flashcards, use a free, easy, and quick computer program or app, (Studyblue, Quizlet and Anki are some great options). You’ll spend all your time physically making the flashcards, and there won’t be any time to study them.
* Study with other people. This one was difficult for me, because I’m so used to studying alone. But study groups at the graduate-level are actually effective, and force you to challenge things you think you understand.
* Look for a couple good resources, but stop searching once you’ve found something that works for you. I kept trying to look for other resources, and realized I was spending WAY too much time not studying by doing this. 
* Actively learn, don't just passively learn (quizzing yourself vs. just reading, drawing out structures vs. just looking at a diagram).
* Collaborate with your classmates! We have a Facebook page for our class, and we are already sharing e-flashcards, YouTube videos, and study sheets we made. 
* Last, and maybe most important, take breaks. How ever you decide to schedule these breaks, this is essential. I’m only 2 weeks in, but I’m already seeing how people get totally burnt out. My strategy is to really hit the ground running during the week, and then try and take at least a half day off on the weekend. 

It’s already intense, but I love it.
