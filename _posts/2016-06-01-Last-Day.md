I spent most of today getting things ready for tomorrow. And trying not to be super anxious. We have two days of orientation, filled with administrative info, program specifics, and general introductions to classmates and faculty. And then Monday is our actual first day. <!--end-->The summer is spent learning physical diagnosis, clinical reasoning, psychosocial aspects to healthcare, and of course, anatomy. As you can guess, the vast majority of everyone’s time is spent learning anatomy. 

It was a strange day though. I couldn’t help but remember when I first started my prerequisite classes for PA school, almost 5 years ago. Comparing how overwhelmed I felt back then to how overwhelmed I feel today was funny. It still doesn’t feel real… Walking through the bookstore on campus and reading e-mails from my new program was definitely surreal.
