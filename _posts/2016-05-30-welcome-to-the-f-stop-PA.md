interesting photography blog. I want to try and update this blog weekly, with tips, tricks, anecdotes, or
answers to reader-submitted questions. <!--end-->I would love to hear feedback, so if you have any questions or 
comments, please feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">e-mail me</a> or submit a question!
