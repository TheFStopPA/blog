Hi there! My name is Matt and I’m a first year PA student at The University of Colorado Child Health Associate Physician Assistant Program, commonly referred to as CHA/PA. I’m a Colorado native, and when I’m not in PA school, I’m generally cooking, baking, running, riding my bike, attempting to brew beer, hanging out with my friends and lovely lady friend, and of course, taking photos.

I decided to create this blog so I can document my journey through PA school. I'm also a wannabe photographer, so I thought I'd include that in this blog as well. My goal is to provide relevant information about the application process, tips and tricks I found helpful, as well as some insight into my daily experience as a PA student. I want to try and update this blog once a week with at least something useful. I would love to answer questions from readers, so if you have any questions, please be sure to send me an [e-mail]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/)!
