Hi there! My name is Matt and I’m a first year PA student at The University of Colorado Child Health Associate Physician Assistant Program, commonly referred to as CHA/PA. I’m a Colorado native, and when I’m not in PA school, I’m generally cooking, baking bread, running, riding my bike, hanging out with my friends and lovely lady friend, attempting to brew beer, and of course, taking photos.

I decided to create this blog so I can document my journey through PA school. I'm also a wannabe photographer, so I thought I'd include that in this blog as well. My goal is to provide relevant information about the application process, tips and tricks I found helpful, as well as some insight into my daily experience as a PA student. I’m a somewhat nontraditional student. I received my Bachelors degree in Political Science and Spanish, and was nonprofit-bound when a series of circumstances led me to again consider medicine. I decided to take the risk and start taking prereqs to get into PA school.

I want to try and update this blog once a week with at least something useful. I would love to answer questions from readers, so if you have any questions, please be sure to send me an [e-mail]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/)!

# What is an F-Stop?

So random aside, some people may wonder what an f-stop is. An f-stop is a measurement of light used in photography, used to describe how open the aperture is in the lens of the camera. It was my attempt to tie my photography to this blog, for better or worse.
